Oh, probably.

Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for
1983 and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?
She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being
scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is
being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games
by 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing
specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.

If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then
I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,
which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).

The problem is, who decides whether that time is ""wasted?""  You don't seem
to think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the
difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the
rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my
mind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing,
or else nothing will be changed.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components
as required."

I wholeheartedly endorse it.

 I have no problem with the

Haven't been to many A's games, have you?

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't
like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going
on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of
reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  

I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy
watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much
dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  

There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going
to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not
willing to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's
revenue from me."

I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic
board, not in the PDS board. I have heard of crashing problems with
PDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why
bother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on
main logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot.

"	Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor
uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been
incredible.
	Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I
remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my
guess he was wearing the exact same duds.  
	The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have
reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets
insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me
a little of the Dodger logo.  
	Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties.
	With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one
in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the
horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it
was meant to be.

Much of the Haight-Ashbury crowd probably had pre-existing 
dissatisfactions with their lives -- dissatisfactions ameliorated by
mumbo-jumbo about 'new realities'. The only change I experienced after 
LSD was to gain the knowledge that I didn't enjoy how LSD twisted my
perception.

"I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts, 
description, and functionality for just about any IC made.
Does such a text exist?  Are there docs on the Internet that
reference IC's?  It would be a great idea if each major
IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files.
(ala RFC style).  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
IC's
are found in the internet anyway.  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference
(as many as possible)?  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little
phonebook-type books that are obsoleted every couple years)"

)Please, supply me with some references.  I was not aware that all states

)uniformly throughout the U.S.

I agree mostly with Chris.  It is (unfortunately, IMO) true that the *FBI*
figures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female
rapes. However, some states (such as Illinois) are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition!"
"I had a GE Emerson 13"" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV)."
