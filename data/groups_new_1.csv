Japan did this.  It required near-total isolation from the rest of the world

Hunting weapons are great for extortionist sharpshooters.  ""Send me money or

"I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than
gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,
Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to ""clean up
diesel emissions"".  Is there anything in the works to
install ""scrubbers"" for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...

"Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for
straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:


I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.
People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but the
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we
are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,
but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a 
different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do
not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt crept in.

Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] 
should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels""?

I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David
was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath
was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.

Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what
he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.
I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that
his whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the 
Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything
and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say
how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.
Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.

Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid
getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing
adultery, we can control our own desires. 

I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other
people see this. 


(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)

Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just 
as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslims
worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"".
Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. 
Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little
more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater 
to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but
you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more
I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my
conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's
conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology
then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Are there any former (or present) ""Eastern Religion"" members here 
who could comment?"

: So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
: quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
: that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
: done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
: easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
: but that will not change their perception.

None of this changes the fact that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior to its
competition.

I have begun to learn in life that the masses never choose the best option
available to them-- they choose the one which they have been conditioned to 
think is best.  I'm glad I'm not one of them.  "

HE IS A CROOK.  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please Help:

I am looking for Dana Weick.  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.
I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  

I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.
I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or
what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)
He never reply my mail.  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get
throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to.  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.
To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he
never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every
of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)

Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still
      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.

So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.
he can be reach at:
			Dana Weick
			4238 W Las Palmaritas
			Phoenix, AZ 85051
    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.
    (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number.


his email address is:
			weick@master.lds-az.loral.com
*******This is our deal

From weick@master.lds-az.loral.com Wed Mar 17 20:09:20 1993

[my address]

Great, you can send the SIMMS to me at:
Dana Weick
4238 W Las Palmaritas
Phoenix, AZ  85051
(602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings)

I would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90)

The CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months.
Thanks

****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID...
that I got the cod payment.
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9

Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real
sympathetic! 
 
If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, 
DON'T GUESS!


********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************

I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was 
busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house
went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-
nected.

Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting away
with it.
